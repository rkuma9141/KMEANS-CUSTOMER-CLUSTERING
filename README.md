# 🛍 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project involves grouping retail store customers into segments based on their purchase behavior using the *K-Means Clustering* algorithm.  
It was developed as part of a Machine Learning Internship task.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- *Algorithm Used*: K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
- *Dataset Used*: Mall Customers Dataset from Kaggle
- *Features Considered*:
  - Annual Income (k$)
  - Spending Score (1–100)
- *Clusters Created*: 5 customer segments

---

## 📁 Files Included

- customer_segmentation_kmeans.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook with complete clustering code and visualization
- Mall_Customers.csv – Dataset used for training the clustering model (from Kaggle)

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📈 Steps Performed

1. Loaded and explored the customer dataset
2. Selected relevant features
3. Applied the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters
4. Trained the K-Means model with optimal clusters
5. Visualized the clustered segments using scatter plots

---

## 📌 Output Snapshot

- 📍 5 Clusters identified:
  - High Income - High Spending
  - Low Income - High Spending
  - Low Income - Low Spending
  - High Income - Low Spending
  - Average Customers

- 📊 Visualization shows well-separated customer segments based on spending habits and income
